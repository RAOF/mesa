mesa (9.1~git20130109.959e83d6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Use xz for all binary packages not just *-dbg.

  [ Timo Aaltonen ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Set close on exec flag when opening dri devices (Closes: #651370).
  * Refresh patches
    - disable 05_kfreebsd-egl-x11.diff for now.
    - switch to llvm-3.2 (Closes: #678822).
  * control: Added libtool to build-depends.
  * rules: Drop special handling of config.{guess,sub}, not needed anymore.
  * rules, libosmesa*: Build only the 32bit OSMesa library.
  * control: Bump libdrm build-dep to 2.4.39.
  * control: Bump libwayland-dev build-dep to 0.95.
  * rules: Update the clean target.
  * rules: Add --disable-shared-glapi to the swx11 targets.
  * libosmesa*.install.in: Install files from the correct path.
  * rules: --with-driver= is deprecated, use --enable-foo.
  * rules: Purge .la files before dh_install.
  * Update symbols.
  * Added 14-fix-osmesa-build.diff, fixes glapi includes with out-of-tree
    builds.
  * libgl1-mesa-dri.install*.in: Add libdricore.
  * control: Add new dependencies to libgl1-mesa-dev.
  * rules, libgl1-mesa-dri.install.linux.in: Add support for radeonsi, but
    disabled for now until support for building it is added to llvm.
  * rules: Build llvm shared libs on platforms that support llvm.
  * control, rules, libglu*: Remove libglu packaging, since it's been split
    off upstream.
  * rules: Disable dri for the swx11 targets.
  * not-installed: Updated.
  * Update symbols for libgles2-mesa
  * libegl1-mesa-drivers.install.linux: Bump libwayland-egl.so version
  * control: Add libdrm-dev to mesa-common-dev Depends.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Install all dri drivers from the DESTDIR tree, instead of copying them
    from the build tree; this simplifies the install rules since we know
    already that we're only building drivers that we want to ship, and
    avoids rpath problems with libtool linking to in-tree convenience
    libraries.
  * debian/rules: don't install libdricore*.so, this isn't a public library.
  * Add Pre-Depends on multiarch-support to libgl1-mesa-dri, since we're
    shipping a shared library in the package; not an issue in practice since
    this is all post-wheezy / post-precise, but it's an archive reject error
    in Debian right now so let's just be complete.

  [ Maarten Lankhorst ]
  * New upstream release 9.0.2.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.9.3.
  * control: Bump libwayland-dev build-dep to 1.0.2.
  * Remove 13-llvm-config-pick-a-version.diff and just pass a flag to configure.
  * Add 16-radeon-ndebug.diff to fix a build failure against llvm

mesa (8.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Only build the radeon, r200, i915 and i965 dri drivers on Linux.  They
    require KMS.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD with libgl1-mesa-dri.install.kfreebsd.in:
    there's no *_dri.so file left in the top directory, only swrast is
    built and shipped under gallium/. So mention it explicitly, in the
    same way as it is done in the libgl1-mesa-dri.install.linux.in file.
  * Enable wayland support again, but only on Linux. Wayland needs some
    porting (it uses *CLOEXEC flags and epoll). For that, add those files
    since EGL packages are also shipped on GNU/kFreeBSD, and we need to
    add a few files for Wayland, but only for Linux:
    - libegl1-mesa-dev.install.linux.in
    - libegl1-mesa-drivers.install.linux.in
  * Limit the wl_drm_interface symbol to arch=linux-any accordingly,
    and bump the version.
  * Limit the build-dependency on libwayland-dev to linux-any too, and
    bump it.
  * Automatically revert changes to bin/{config.{guess,sub},install-sh} in
    the clean target. The first two are modified, the last one needs to be
    turned back into a symlink.

    - dri: Remove all DRI1 drivers (e4344161bd).
  * Update not-installed for removed files.
  * Stop trying to ship swrastg through libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental,
    it replaced the non-gallium variant.

  [ Timo Aaltonen ]
  * Refresh patches.
  * control: Add libxcb-glx0-dev to build-depends.
  * control: Drop libglw1-mesa, libglw1-mesa-dev, glw got moved to a

mesa (7.11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge patch from Pino Tiscano (thanks!):
    - Use hurd-any instead of: hurd-i386 (“wildcard archs are free”).
    - Use any-i386 instead of: i386 kfreebsd-i386 hurd-i386.
    - Rewrite a check in debian/rules to follow the same logic.
    - Switch libgbm1-dbg to arch: linux-any. This fixes uninstallability
      on kfreebsd-* by getting rid of this package there.
    - Switch libglapi-mesa{,-dbg} arch: any. This fixes the FTBFS on

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Fix regression from 7.10, missing characters in text display with
      intel drivers (Closes: #631516). Thanks to Martin Steigerwald for
      the report and the tests.
  * Temporarily disable Wayland EGL backend as it requires a newer
    libwayland-dev
  * Update rules for configure changes
  * debian/lib{egl1,openvg1}-mesa.install.in:
  * debian/libegl1-mesa-drivers.install.in:
    - Stop trying to install st_{GL,OpenVG} and pipe_*
      as they are all now built in to egl_gallium.so
  * Add libgbm{1,1-dbg,-dev} packages for the new buffer-manager library.
  * Drop 12-llvm-config-check.diff; upstream.
  * Refresh 13-llvm-config-pick-a-version.diff for new upstream.
  * Add strictly versioned dependencies on libglapi-mesa to libgl1-mesa-glx
    and libegl1-mesa-drivers as they also now depend on this internal library.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-dri.install.linux.in:
    - Manually install r300g only when we actually build it.  Fixes build on
      non-i386, non-amd64 linux.

  [ Julien Cristau ]

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jun 2011 21:26:00 +0200

mesa (7.11~0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, from the master branch (up to 2fe39b46e7).
  * Drop 05_hurd-ftbfs.diff, merged upstream (as 758561786c).
  * Refresh 06_kfreebsd-ftbfs.diff (due to 8fd8de3995).
  * Refresh 08-kfreebsd-gallium.diff (adjust offsets).
  * Add 10-hurd-configure-tweaks.diff to enable x86 assembler on Hurd,
    thanks to Pino Toscano.
  * Refresh 11-hurd-ftbfs-again.diff (adjust offsets and drop the
    src/gallium/auxiliary/os/os_time.c hunk, which should be OK since
    PIPE_OS_UNIX is used there, and should happily replace the use of
    PIPE_OS_HURD; and adapt for the removal of the PIPE_OS_EMBEDDED check).
  * debian/libegl1-mesa.install.in: Stop trying to install egl_dri2.so and
    egl_glx.so, since they are now built-in (since c98ea26e16).
  * debian/libgles{1,2}-mesa.install.in: Stop trying to install
    st_GLESv{1,2}_CM.so (respectively), which got removed. Quoting the
    commit message: “Remove GLES overlay. With core mesa doing runtime API
    checks, GLES overlay is no longer needed.” (12583174c5).
  * Drop --enable-gles-overlay from debian/rules accordingly.
  * Add 12-llvm-config-check.diff to handle --disable-gallium more
    properly.
  * Add 13-llvm-config-pick-a-version.diff, so that llvm-config-2.9 is
    searched by configure, instead of unversioned llvm-config.
  * Add a NOT_INSTALLED_EITHER variable to debian/not-installed. A few
    files might have to be removed, but only if that's a git snapshot
    (those files aren't in the released tarballs). Let's consider it's OK
    to run “rm -f” on them: {,dri/}usr/include/GL/glut{,f90}.h
  * Add libglapi-mesa{,-dbg} packages.
  * Use a package-name-doesnt-match-sonames override accordingly.
  * Update libegl1-mesa.symbols with new symbols.
  * Update libgles{1,2}-mesa.symbols now that internal symbols (_glapi_*
    and _glthread_GetID) moved to libglapi-mesa.
  * Add a gentarball target, to generate tarballs for git snapshots.
  * Replace “The OpenGL utility library…” with “Mesa OpenGL utility
    library…” in the description of the libglu1-mesa* packages.
  * Replace radeon with r300 in GALLIUM_DRIVERS to match upstream renaming
    (5722286be2).
  * Build r300 classic (through DRI_DRIVERS) everywhere, since r300g comes
    with a few additional requirements: LLVM is needed for this driver,
    and apparently only works fine on x86 platform. As a consequence, only
    build r300g on amd and i386, and add llvm-2.9-dev build-dep on those
    platforms accordingly. Disable it explicitly on other platforms.
  * Stop building i915g at all, it's apparently never going to be a
    suitable replacement for i915c.
  * Add libwayland-dev build-dep.
  * Add wayland to EGL_DISPLAYS on Linux.
  * Ship wayland-egl.pc and libwayland-egl.so in libegl1-mesa-dev; and ship
    libwayland-egl.so.1* in libegl1-mesa-drivers.
  * Update libegl1-mesa.symbols with new wl_drm_interface symbol.

    (Closes: #631236).
  * Merge upstream 7.10 branch up to e041956cb2.
  * Wrap Breaks fields.
  * Add Breaks: {xserver-xorg-core,libgl1-mesa-glx}-no-multiarch to
    libgl1-mesa-dri* to handle upgrades from squeeze-backports (without
    multiarch) to wheezy (with multiarch).
  * Add lintian overrides for breaks-without-version accordingly, those
    packages are only provided in squeeze-backports.
  * Replace “The OpenGL utility library…” with “Mesa OpenGL utility
    library…” in the description of the libglu1-mesa* packages.
  * Rename all remaining *.install files as *.install.in and use
    “${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}” instead of “*”.
  * Use the sed substitution on all debian/*.in files accordingly.
  * Remove debian/clean, and use the same for loop to remove the generated
    files.
  * Set urgency to “medium” to speed things up. Migration to testing is
    a prerequisite for squeeze backports.

  [ Sven Joachim ]
  * Fix comments in libegl1-mesa.symbols to avoid impending FTBFS with
    the upcoming dpkg-dev 1.16.1.

  * Update the “Breaks: xserver-xorg-core” from “(<= 2:1.10.2-1)” to
    “(<< 2:1.10.2-2)”. The first binNMU migrated to testing too soon,
    so it was needed to rebuild it again, in testing. Updating the
    Breaks makes sure that a multiarch mesa doesn't get installed with
    a server built against a pre-multiarch mesa.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Add Breaks against nvidia and fglrx packages, since they are also
    affected by the multiarch changes, and need fixing. Until fixed
    packages reach the archive, nvidia and fglrx users should stick to
    mesa 7.10.2-3 packages, currently available in testing. Thanks to
    Andreas and Patrick for the version strings (Closes: #630710).
  * Set CXXFLAGS along with CFLAGS (Closes: #630602). Thanks for the
    report and the patch, Fabio Pedretti!

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Explanation of the “Breaks: xserver-xorg-core” part for our users: the

mesa (7.10-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Add patch: 10-fix-talloc-linking.diff
  * Use debian/not-installed to keep track of files which aren't getting
    installed for now. Delete them before running dh_install. Use the list
    of files appearing in the build logs for 7.9+repack-2.
  * Switch from --list-missing to --fail-missing accordingly.
  * Pass -c4 to dpkg-gensymbols through dh_makeshlibs to make sure
    symbol-related changes are noticed and dealt with.
  * Update symbols files with new symbols:
    - libopenvg1-mesa.symbols
  * Remove “mesa internal ASM optimized functions” lines from symbols
    files, those seem to be gone, and with -c4 passed to dpkg-gensymbols,
    any related issue will break the build:
    - libgles1-mesa.symbols
    - libgles2-mesa.symbols
  * Stop using dh_strip -s --remaining-packages. When a build is resumed
    (-nc), this dh_strip call is a no-op if it was previously written to
    the debhelper log files. Specify all remaining packages instead.
    That's boring, but avoid getting non-stripped packages.
  * Add debian/git-cleanup.sh script to ease removing files in git which
    aren't in the release tarballs, and make dpkg-source error out.
  * Keep my eyes wide shut and add myself to Uploaders.

      09-intel-fix-invalidate-before-initialisation.diff dropped, they were
      backports from upstream
    - 04_osmesa_version.diff updated
  * Add build-dep on talloc.
  * Drop the mesa-utils package, demos were moved out of the mesa tree.
  * Use --with-egl-platforms instead of --with-egl-displays, and replace kms
    with drm.
  * Merge some packaging changes from ubuntu:
    - libegl1-mesa-drivers-x11,kms: There are no longer separate kms or x11
      drivers for EGL, libegl1-mesa-drivers now contains a single driver that
      provides both backends (Christopher James Halse Rogers)
    - Remove pre-generated .pc's, use the ones generated at build time instead
      (Robert Hooker)
    - Build the r600 gallium driver
    - Update symbols files
  * README.source: we don't need to repack MesaLib.tar.gz anymore.
  * Kill old sourceforge url from debian/watch.

    dependency on libxt-dev and lesstif2-dev.
  * Add new lintian overrides for the package-name-doesnt-match-sonames stuff.
  * Don't ship progs/objviewer in the tarball, it's insanely big and unused.
  * New upstream release.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Stop shipping an upstream git log, it's unlikely to be useful to anyone,
    and it's big.
  * debian/scripts/choose-configs: use DEB_HOST_ARCH, not DEB_BUILD_ARCH
    (closes: #451648).
  * Rename radeong_dri.so to r300_dri.so in build, not binary.

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * debian/patches/07-nouveau-update.diff:
    - Pull in nouveau_class.h header no longer shipped by libdrm 2.4.21 and 
      update nouveau build to use it.  Fixes FTBFS against libdrm 2.4.21.
  * debian/rules:
    - Simplify selecting which gallium drivers are built.  Use this to only
      act on gallium packages on archs where we're actually building them.
      Part of the fix for FTBFS on Hurd and kFreeBSD.

    - “make install” puts classic and gallium drivers in the same path, but
      builds gallium drivers in the gallium/ subdirectory.  Copy the drivers 
      directly from the build path, rather than trying to separate them out 
      post-hock.

  * Statically link libOSMesa with the software rasterization code from libGL
    so that it works independently of the installed libGL. (Closes: #387706)
  * Make libosmesa6-dev depend on mesa-common-dev because it only needs the
    gl.h header file and no libGL anymore.
  * Move glx*.h headers from libgl1-mesa(-swx11)-dev into mesa-common-dev
    because both packages provide identical files.
  * Add debugging symbol packages for libgl1-mesa-swx11, libgl1-mesa-glx and

  * Add patch from Cyril Brulebois to allow package to build on HURD, which
    lacks DRI and directfb. This includes not using lib-directfb in the
    build-depends for hurd-i386. It also creates a new debian config,

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Upload mesa 6.5 cvs to unstable, because we need it for Xorg 7.1.
  * Upload with medium urgency instead of high, since this is a new
    upstream that should get some testing in unstable in spite of the
    multiple RC bugfixes.
  * Update debian/copyright with the full text of the SGI Free B and SGI
    MIT-style licenses in use in the package, and take a stab at
    cleaning up the list of paths and licenses.
    Closes: #368562.
  * Make mesa-common-dev Replaces: xlibosmesa-dev from sarge.
    Closes: #384057.
  * Fix libgl1-mesa-glx to not Provides: libgl1-mesa-dri, since it
    definitely doesn't provide DRI support and this Provides: breaks
    upgrades from sarge.  Closes: #384282.
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-swx11.shlibs: create a static shlibs file,
    because libOSMesa.so.6 is not provided by all implementations of
    libGL and so needs a separate shlibs declaration.  Also make
    libgl1-mesa-glx the default alternative instead of libgl1-mesa-swx11
    for consistency even when building against libgl1-mesa-swx11,
    because to the extent these are interchangeable (i.e., 99%...),
    there should be no reason to prefer one over the other -- and to the
    extent that they aren't interchangeable, it's wrong to list libgl1
    as an alternative dependency at all.  Closes: #386185.
  * Don't provide shlibs at all for libgl1-mesa-swx11-dbg; this is an
    unnecessary duplication of the existing libgl1-mesa-swx11 shlibs
    since packages should not really be linking against /usr/lib/debug/
    separately.
  * src/mesa/tnl/t_vb_render.c: Drop a pointless printf() in the
    RENDER_LINE macro, getting rid of copious debug output on console.
    Closes: #369895.
  * libgl1-mesa-swx11 has no reason to depend on libglu, anything that
    wants libglu will have its own dependency on it; drop this
    hard-coded dependency from debian/control.
  * Have libglu1-mesa-dev Provides: xlibmesa-glu-dev, since it's the
    successor to that package and xlibmesa-glu-dev is still referenced
    in a number of places and this makes for more reliable builds than
    depending on alternatives without requiring another dummy -dev
    package from xorg.
  * Replace references to Source-Version in debian/control with either 
    binary:Version or source:Version, depending on whether the
    relationship references an arch: any or arch: all package, making
    mesa binNMU-safe; add build-depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to
    ensure these substvars are available.

          Rationale: integrated chipsets available only for i386 processors.
        + Built only for i386: ffb.
          Rationale: Michel Dänzer said so, no idea why.
        + Built only for i386, amd64: i915.
          Rationale: Apparently this is available in the 64-bit Intel chipset.
    Please file a bug report stating which drivers should be included/excluded
    for which architectures.  Positive lists are preferred.  If possible state
    why.
  * debian/mesa-swx11-source.install: nuke this abomination.  Dinamically
    generate the list at build time.
  * debian/drivers.map: add gl-debian-dri_i386
  * debian/README.build: updated, add big friendly letters in short sentences.
    Perhaps I can read it myself this way...
  * debian/rules, configs/debian, configs/debian-dri, configs/debian_i386,
    configs/debian-dri_i386, debian/libdir.map, debian/drivers.map: hack in
    support for variable driver's dir.  If you want this for your pet
    architecture please provide BOTH configs/debian_arch and
    configs/debian-dri_arch.  If you just want to include/exclude DRI drivers
    on your architecture look in configs/debian-dri.
  * configs/debian*_i386: disabled, optimized build fuxxored.
  * debian/rules: remove misguided Perl construct, replace by something
    simpler in shell.  I actually meant to do something else with the Perl
    thing, but got distracted and forgot about it.  Thanks Aaron M. Ucko!
  * debian/rules: make it work like debian/README.build says it works wrt to
    building optimized targets.

  * debian/libgl1-mesa-dri-dev.install: install GLX include files here, too.
  * debian/rules: GLU and GLW don't have arch-specific targets.

  [ Daniel Stone <daniels@debian.org> ]
  * New upstream version, incorporating changes from Ubuntu 6.3 packaging.

    for DRI configuration.  Break out xlibs-dev Build-Depends to the
    individual libraries required.
  * Bump libdrm-dev Build-Depends to >> 1.0.5, in order to get new
    via_drm.h to build the unichrome DRI driver.

mesa (6.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: big mess up, files are not being moved to their proper
    places.  I naively assumed that command-line options to debhelper
    commands would override DH_OPTIONS, that is, that having
    DH_OPTIONS=-i (as suggested in the documentation) would mean
    something like "use -i unless -p is passed on the command line".  It
    actually means "use -i in addition to -p passed on the command
    line", which does not make any sense, but is consistent with the
    wording in the documentation. (closes: bug#306499, bug#306918,

mesa (6.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "thank you so much, I'm still voting against you" release.
  * debian/rules: correct artifact of me not having had a proper
    pbuilder environment to build stuff on and the repackaging from the
    previous release.  The -glu- and -glw- targets now explicitly depend
    on the matching -gl- target, and symlinks are placed in the build
    directories in order to actually have a libGL.so to make ld happy
    when creating the libraries.
  * debian/rules: uncomment dh_install :-\  There was a reason why I had
    commented that out...
  * First change closes: bug#298922
  * Second change closes: bug#300302, bug#300284, bug#300430

  * Repackage:
        + Fall prey to debhelper
        + Entries below this one preserved for historical reasons or
          sentimental value, pick as many as you want.  They bear NO
          relation to the actual packages!
  * configs/debian, configs/debian-debug, configs/debian-debug-i386,

    configs/debian-osmesa32, configs/debian-osmesa32-static,
    configs/debian-static, configs/debian-static-i386: new files.
  * configs/debian-sparc: Dave Miller confirmed that the sparc assembly
    files do work on Linux.  I don't know where to install the optimized
    libraries, so the file doesn't actually exist.  Please read
    debian/README.build if you want to have a sparc-optimized library.
  * debian/control: GGI and glide2 are gone.  glide is glide3.
  * debian/rules: modify shlibs file for the glide3 target to require glide3
    and only glide3 because that library exports functions not available in
    other libGLs.  Rationale: if someone is compiling a Debian package and
    uses the glide target either he doesn't know what he is doing or he knows
    exactly what he is doing.  In the first case the package should not be
    installable and in the second case the package requires this particular
    version.
  * debian/control: libgl1-mesa-glide3-dev does NOT provide a proper OpenGL
    development environment (see above).
  * PCR is bound to be wrong... *sigh*

mesa (5.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "it's amazing how people pick severities" release
  * debian/control: mesa-common-dev conflicts with xlibmesa-dev.  Actually put
    dependency of mesa-common-dev on the mesa-*-dev packages to avoid having
    to track other libgl-dev packages popping up.  IMO this is less error
    prone.  You can't install mesa-common-dev without installing mesa-*-dev,
    and those packages conflict with other libgl-dev packages.  (closes:
    bug#177996)
  * Rename libglu1c102 to libglu1-mesa; the libglu1c102 is incorrent since
    this library does not export C++ functions.  Sorry about the mess.
  * Rename libglu1-dev to libglu1-mesa-dev to be consistent
  * debian/rules: use grep-dctrl to extract architectures from debian/control
  * debian/control: add grep-dctrl to build-depends
  * debian/shlibs.libglu: libglu1-mesa | libglu1
  * debian/rules: install include/GL/xmesa.h in /usr/include/GL/xmesa.h; I'm
    not 100% sure this is the right thing to do, but it's a niche so I don't
    think it will actually make trouble (closes: bug#148866)
  * debian/rules: install include/GL/glx*.h in the common package.  (closes:

  * debian/rules: nasty hack to work arround libtool's idea of how libraries
    should be linked (closes: bug#178514)
  * debian/rules: even nastier hack.  Getting environment variables to
    percolate thru all the make calls isn't getting anywhere.
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: export only glu.* symbols
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: add -lm to link line
